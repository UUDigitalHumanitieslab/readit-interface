I remember reading years ago of the melancholy physiognomy of King
Charles I, which when seen in his portrait by a Florentine sculptor, to
whom it was sent in order that a bust should be made from it, drew forth
the observation that the countenance indicated that its owner would come
to a violent death.
I was reminded of this anecdote by the face of the Duchesse d'Angoulême;
for though I do not pretend to a prescience as to her future fate, I cannot
help arguing from it that, even should a peaceful reign await her, the
fearful trials of her youth have destroyed in her the power of enjoyment;
and that on a throne she can never forget the father and mother she saw
hurried from it, to meet every insult that malice could invent, or cruelty
could devise, before a violent death freed them from their sufferings.
<br><br>
id_19_b, p 190
I have been reading some French poems by Madame Amabel Tastu;
and very beautiful they are. A sweet and healthy tone of mind breathes
through them, and the pensiveness that characterises many of them,
marks a reflecting spirit imbued with tenderness. There is great harmony,
too, in the versification, as well as purity and elegance in the diction. How
much some works make us wish to know their authors, and vice versa ! I
feel, while reading her poems, that I should like Madame Amabel Tastu;
while other books, whose cleverness I admit, convince me I should not
like the writers.

I walked with Comte d'O-- this evening into the Champs-Elysees,
and great was the change effected there within the last few days. It looks
ruined and desolate, the ground cut up by the pieces of cannon, and
troops as well as the mobs that have made it a thoroughfare, and many
of the trees greatly injured, if not destroyed.
A crowd was assembled around a man who was reading aloud for their
edification a proclamation nailed to one of the trees. We paused for a
moment to hear it, when some of the persons recognising my companion,
shouted aloud, "Vive le Comte d'Orsay! Vive le Comte d'Orsay" and the
cry being taken up by the mass, the reader was deserted, the fickle mul-
titude directing all their attention and enthusiasm to the new comer. We
had some difficulty in escaping from these troublesome and unexpected
demonstrations of good will; and, while hurrying from the scene of this
impromptu ovation to the unsought popularity of my companion, I made
him smile by hinting at the danger in which he stood of being raised to
the vacant throne by those who seem not to know or care who is to till
it.

Mr. Sharpling : "I am a clockmaker, and live in Duck-lane; I have been
acquainted with the prisoner about two or three years; last Thursday was
with him between four and five o'clock, he was very much in liquor, this
was at the Bear and Ragged staff; I was looking over the newspaper, he
insisted on my drinking a glass of wine with him; I said, you had better
go and lie down; he said to me you shall drink a glass, and then you and
I will go and take a ride for six or seven miles".

Titre : Letters from France, written in the years 1803 and 1804 : in-
cluding a particular account of Verdun, and the situation of the British
captives in that city. Volume 2 / by James Forbes. Date d'édition : 1806.

id_21_a, p 295-296
We left the Meuse at some distance on our right, but found a smaller
river called the Aire, flowing through Varennes, and supplying the mills at
the foot of the surrounding eminences. It is a most insignificant place, but
its connexion with the great events of the revolution makes it interesting
we were shown the dwelling-house where the royal family were arrested,
and that of Sausse the tallow-chandler, the procureur de la commune,
where they passed the night on the 21st of June 1791, as I mentioned
at St. Menehoud. On viewing the spot, and reading the account of the
arrest in different histories of the revolution, it is evident to me that
matters must have been very ill managed either, by the ill-fated monarch
or those about him.

We have been much gratified for these ten days past with Texier's
public reading, whom you have probably heard in London, where he was
in vogue many years. His versatility of talent is very great, and French
comedy is admirably adapted to display it. He has met with general
encouragement at Verdun, and is now on bis route to several of the
German courts ; from whence he intends to proceed to St. Petersburgh.

id_22_a, p 177
The whole place, with its repeated steps, its balustrades, its massive
and plentiful stonework, is full of the air of the last century -- sent bien
son dix-huitième siècle ; none the less so, I am afraid, that, as I read
in my faithful Murray, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the
block, the stake, the wheel had been erected here for the benefit of the
desperate Camisards.
<br><br>
id_22_b, p 265
"C'est l'heure de la lecture," remarked my guide and a group of con-
valescents -- all the patients I saw were women -- were gathered in the
centre around a nun, the points of whose white hood nodded a little
above them and whose gentle voice came to us faintly, with a little echo,
down the high perspective. I know not what the good sister was reading
-- a dull book, I am afraid -- but there was so much colour and such
a fine, rich air of tradition about the whole place that it seemed to me
I would have risked listening to her. I turned away, however, with that
sense of defeat which is always irritating to the appreciative tourist, and
pottered about Beaune rather vaguely for the rest of my hour [...].
<br><br>
id_22_c, p 249-251
I sat in the train (which waited a long time at Lyons) and, by the
light of one of the big lamps on the platform, read all sorts of disagreeable
things in certain radical newspapers which I had bought at the bookstall.
I gathered from these sheets that Lyons was in extreme commotion.

Titre : The Nocturnal pleasures of Paris. A guide to the gay city, by
captain Wray Sylvester Auteur : Sylvester, Wray. Date d'édition : 1889.
Droits : domaine public. Provenance : Bibliothèque nationale de France.

id_23_a, p9-10
I remember reading in a smart London periodical, since extinct, an
article, headed "The Judgment of Paris," which was evidently written
by such a person, and in which the writer endeavoured to prove that
the reputation of Paris, as the gayest city in the world, was a wholly
undeserved one, and that her claim to this distinction rested on the
falsest of false pretences. Now this is all nonsense.
<br><br>
id_23_b, p 126
And now for a remark which is somewhat of a, personal nature.
I daresay, some hypocrite will get hold of this book, and after reading it,
cry: "What a blackguard that Captain Wray is to write about such
things. How can he do so?" Hypocrite, I answer you by saying : " It is not I who advise you to
frequent these places, or to seek such enjoyments. My role is to describe
them to you, with strict truth, and to moralize neither one way nor the
other.

I wondered if I had not done a very silly thing in being independent,
and in not doing as my brothers had done, reading "The Times" in
an office every morning from ten to twelve, and playing dominoes in
the afternoon, and auction bridge in the evening, and having several
thousands a year when I was forty, and a Wolseley car to take my wife
for a holiday to Windermere, because she looked pale, or because we were
bored with each other. I smiled to think of the look on my brothers' faces
if I suddenly appeared at their ofice one morning, and said that it was
no good, and that I couldn't write, and was very hungry.

The two men looked at the station clock, having nothing further to
"What were you reading in the paper?" Birkin asked.
Gerald looked at him quickly.
"Isn't it funny, what they do put in the newspapers," he said.
"Here are two leaders--" he held out his Daily Telegraph, "full of the
ordinary newspaper cant--" he scanned the columns down--"and then
there's this little--I dunno what you'd call it, essay, almost--appearing
with the leaders, and saying there must arise a man who will give new
values to things, give us new truths, a new attitude to life, or else we
shall be a crumbling nothingness in a few years, a country in ruin--"
"I suppose that's a bit of newspaper cant, as well," said Birkin.
"It sounds as if the man meant it, and quite genuinely," said Gerald.
"Give it to me," said Birkin, holding out his hand for the paper.
The train came, and they went on board, sitting on either side a
little table, by the window, in the restaurant car. Birkin glanced over his
paper, then looked up at Gerald, who was waiting for him.
"I believe the man means it," he said, "as far as he means anything."
"And do you think it's true? Do you think we really want a new
gospel?" asked Gerald. Birkin shrugged his shoulders.
"I think the people who say they want a new religion are the last
to accept anything new. They want novelty right enough. But to stare
straight at this life that we've brought upon ourselves, and reject it,
absolutely smash up the old idols of ourselves, that we sh'll never do.
You've got very badly to want to get rid of the old, before anything new
will appear--even in the self."
Gerald watched him closely.
"You think we ought to break up this life, just start and let fly?" he
asked. "This life. Yes I do. We've got to bust it completely, or shrivel inside
it, as in a tight skin. For it won't expand any more."

There was something extremely agreeable in the cheerful flow of an-
imal spirits of the little man ; and I confess I had heen somewhat sur-
prised at his apt quotations from authors who certainly were not in the
range of every-day reading. I mentioned this last circumstance to Frank
Bracebridge, who told me with a smile that Master Simon's whole stock
of erudition was confined to some half a dozen old authors, which the
squire had put into his hands, and which he read over and over whenever
he had a studious fit, as he sometimes had on rainy day, or a long winter
evening.

I have read the whole of Jane Austen and think of beginning over
again. What a perfect woman - not only a writer - and what a sham she
makes all this female emancipation seem! Nothing that is not genuine
can stand this primitive severity.
But Jane would have been quite at
home and talked tea- table gossip with the ladies of Huraidha.

Well, there were no pictures in it... I can't... Well... books, they
all looked the same because they were usually hard backs... they had a
detachable flyleaf on them... hmmm... no... The Magic Faraway Tree
was a plain green almost cloth kind of cover, so, it wasn't a library book,
so... but it wasn't a new book, so... somebody else had given it to us, I
guess...

These were girls from the so-called Polish Service organisation. We
saw them shouldering pickaxes and spades and marching joyfully off to
work. There were also women tending looms and lathes. Times have
changed. We now see women working in design offices, on computers, or
on the new production lines for electronic equipment, mobile telephones
and televisions. We also see the tired faces of women hurrying home after
many hours of hard work to undertake other daily tasks. Those were the
images that came to my mind as I read Mrs Figueiredo's report on the
role of women in industry.
For many years now, efforts have been made to protect women, reduce
their workload and treat them in the same way as men are treated.
Unfortunately, differences persist to this day.

A: No, at college, yes I think I was on the courses -- yes. I did read
a book which made a big impression on me and it was called I Bought
a Mountain and it was by Esmé and Thomas Somebody and I can't
remember who they were. And this couple had bought a farm in Wales
and, you know, set about it and made it work, and it was a sheep farm,
of course. It was lovely. Years later, after I was married and we did a lot
of camping, we actually went to camp on their grounds and I met Esmé
and Thomas, and told them that as a teenager I had read their book.
And by that time they were, you know, quite grizzled people.

[general laughter] I'm painting a very
dark picture of my Mum. She was a delightful person but she was quite
happy for me to do my own thing and in those days, it was reading. Cos
obviously if you were listening to radio you were impinging on somebody
else's space, weren't you so? Unless you were listening as a family -- you
probably weren't listening.
