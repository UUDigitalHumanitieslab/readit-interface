        text: 'I walked with Comte d\'O-- this evening into the Champs-Elysees, and great was the change effected \
        there within the last few days. It looks ruined and desolate, the ground cut up by the pieces of cannon, and \
        troops as well as the mobs that have made it a thoroughfare, and many of the trees greatly injured, if not destroyed. \
        A crowd was assembled around a man who was reading aloud for their edification a proclamation nailed to one of \
        the trees. We paused for a moment to hear it, when some of the persons recognising my companion, shouted aloud, \
        "Vive le Comte d\'Orsay! Vive le Comte d\'Orsay" and the cry being taken up by the mass, the reader was deserted, \
        the fickle multitude directing all their attention and enthusiasm to the new comer. We had some diffculty in \
        escaping from these troublesome and unexpected demonstrations of good will; and, while hurrying from the scene of \
        this impromptu ovation to the unsought popularity of my companion, I made him smile by hinting at the danger in \
        which he stood of being raised to the vacant throne by those who seem not to know or care who is to till it.',

        text: 'I have been reading some French poems by Madame Amabel Tastu; \
        and very beautiful they are. A sweet and healthy tone of mind breathes \
        through them, and the pensiveness that characterises many of them, \
        marks a reecting spirit imbued with tenderness. There is great harmony, \
        too, in the versication, as well as purity and elegance in the diction. How \
        much some works make us wish to know their authors, and vice versa ! I \
        feel, while reading her poems, that I should like Madame Amabel Tastu; \
        while other books, whose cleverness I admit, convince me I should not \
        like the writers.',

        text: 'I remember reading years ago of the melancholy physiognomy of King \
        Charles I, which when seen in his portrait by a Florentine sculptor, to \
        whom it was sent in order that a bust should be made from it, drew forth\
        the observation that the countenance indicated that its owner would come\
        to a violent death.\
        I was reminded of this anecdote by the face of the Duchesse d\'AngoulÃªme;\
        for though I do not pretend to a prescience as to her future fate, I cannot\
        help arguing from it that, even should a peaceful reign await her, the\
        fearful trials of her youth have destroyed in her the power of enjoyment;\
        and that on a throne she can never forget the father and mother she saw\
        hurried from it, to meet every insult that malice could invent, or cruelty\
        could devise, before a violent death freed them from their sufferings.',
